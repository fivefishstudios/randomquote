                came home from school,<br> 'cause she was two years older,<br> And she had boys in her room.<br> We listened
                outside and heard her.<br> Alright.

            <p>Well that was alright for a while,<br> But soon I wanted more.<br> I want to see as well as hear,<br> And so
                I hid inside her wardrobe.<br> And she came round four,<br> And she was with some kid called David,<br> From
                the garage up the road.<br> I listened outside I heard her.<br> Alright.
